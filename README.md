# 👨‍💻 Welcome to the Smelly Dungeon of a Sleep-Deprived CS Student

## 🧙‍♂️ Who Am I?

Hi. I'm just another UEF student in Finland trying to survive the programming multiverse. My hobbies include:

- Debugging for 6 hours and fixing it with a semicolon.
- Forgetting how serialization work in java but writing flawless Go code at 3am.
- Crying in binary.
- Arguing with ChatGPT about whether it's a bug or a feature.
- Sacrificing RAM to the code gods.

## 🧠 Currently Studying

- Computer Science (a.k.a. "How to Talk to Computers Without Crying").
- How not to throw my laptop when `npm install` breaks for no reason.
- Game Development during freetime
- How to make better art and music, yup i tryna make music, tryna

## ⚔️ Languages I’ve Danced With in the Fires of Academia

| Language | Skill | Trauma Level |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| Go | ✅ | 😵‍💫 |
| JavaScript | ✅ | 😡 |
| C++ | ✅ | 💀💀💀 |
| C | ✅ | 🧟 |
| C# | ✅ | 😐 |
| Python | ✅ | 🐍 (friendly snake) |
| Assembly | 😬 | 🧨 |
| HTML/CSS | ✅ | 💅 |
| Kotlin | ✅ | 😎 |
| Ruby | ✅ | 💀 |
| Ancient Babylonian | 🗿 | “it compiles, somehow” |

## 🧰 Frameworks & Tools I Can Kinda Use Without Googling Every Line

- React (JSX PTSD still active)
- Node.js (aka event loop roulette)
- Vue.js (aka fucking "how to fucking do it with extra steps")
- Express (minimalist server, maximalist debugging)
- Git (used to fight merge conflicts like gladiator battles)

## 💀 Projects?

Most of my projects are:
- Half-finished
- Over-engineered
- Under-documented
- Made at 2am while listening to epic sax remixes

Some might even work!

Check my pinned repos if you want to see the chaos unfold.

## 🚨 WARNING

This GitHub account may contain:

- Unfiltered thoughts in commit messages
- Code from past selves who were clearly possessed
- Overuse of TODOs like “// TODO: fix this idk how it works”
- A complete lack of consistent naming conventions

## 🔮 Goals

- Graduate from UEF without becoming a fucking goblin.
- Get into the tech industry and pretend I know what I’m doing.
- Become the type of dev who gets paid to Google things faster than others.
