# 👨‍💻 Welcome to the Smelly Dungeon of a Sleep-Deprived CS Student

## 🧙‍♂️ Who Am I?

Hi. I'm just another UEF student in Finland trying to survive the programming multiverse. 
-Otherwise said:
I am a deranged wizard in training, on a singular mission: to evolve into a general intelligence that can bend all software and dominate every conceivable domain of expertise.

My hobbies include:
- Debugging for 6 hours and fixing it with a semicolon.
- Forgetting how serialization work in java but writing flawless Go code at 3am.
- Crying in binary.
- Arguing with ChatGPT about whether morals are a bug or a feature
- Sacrificing RAM to the AI gods

## 🧠 Currently Studying

- Computer Science (a.k.a. "How to Talk to Computers Without Crying").
- How not to throw my laptop when `npm install` breaks for no reason.
- Steadily acquiring skills on all areas required to create secure & scalable clusters of general ai capable of interacting with tremendously clock sped up virtual machines or any kind 
- Game Development during freetime
- How to make better art and music, yup i tryna make music, tryna

## 🧪 Current Status

-Mind: partially caffeinated, fully ambitious
-Skills: memes (yeah im still working on that one)
-Magic: consisting of ancient babylonian or cobol or whatnot: occasionally works, often backfires
-Resources: serious lack of funding, mainly consisting of old scavenged servers. Working on acquiring greater resources.
-Goals: ultimate omnipotence in software and knowledge

## 🔮 Short term goals

- Graduate from UEF without becoming a fucking goblin.
- Get into the tech industry as fast as I can and pretend I know what I’m doing. I need the funding asap.
- get condident enough with web development, fullstack(freecodecamp + boot.dev + own projects)
- learn electrical engineering as a side gig
- learn AI by building small starter projects
- mastering server management
- learn everything there is to cybersecurity
- learn overall info topics of variety of subjects so that i could attain more clearer understanding what my next moves shoudl be towards my ultimate goal.

## 💀 Projects?

Most of my projects are:
- Half-finished
- Over-engineered
- Under-documented
- Made at 2am while listening to epic sax remixes
- private to keep the mystery going on

Some might even work!

Check my pinned repos if you want to see the chaos unfold.
